## Modifying and Verifying Status

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the "ellipsis-git-2023" directory.

3. Open the "styles.css" file in a text editor.

4. Modify the content of the "styles.css" file as desired.

5. To verify the status, run:
   `git status`

Verify that the "styles.css" file is listed under "Changes not staged for commit".

## Undoing Changes

1. To undo the changes made to "styles.css" and restore it to its previous state, run:
   `git checkout styles.css`

## Removing "styles2.css" and Making a Commit:

1. To remove "styles2.css" from the Git repository, run:
   `git rm styles2.css`

2. Commit the removal with a meaningful commit message, e.g.:
   `git commit -m "Remove styles2.css"`

## Undoing the Last Commit

1. To undo the last commit and restore the repository to the previous commit, run:
   `git reset HEAD`

Note: This will remove the last commit from the history, but the changes made will still be present in the working directory.

2. To completely discard the changes made in the last commit, use the `--hard` option:
   `git reset --hard HEAD`
