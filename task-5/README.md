## Creating a New Branch and Merging

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Ensure you are inside the "ellipsis-git-2023" directory.

3. To create a new branch called "feature2-branch", run:
   `git branch feature2-branch`

4. To switch to the newly created branch, run:
   `git checkout feature2-branch`

5. Make changes to the "index.html" file in the "feature2-branch" as desired.

6. To merge the changes from "feature-branch" into the "main" branch, run:

```
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

## Merging "feature2-branch" and Resolving Merge Conflict

1. To merge the changes from "feature2-branch" into "main", run:
   `git merge feature2-branch`

2. If there is a merge conflict, Git will notify you. Open the "index.html" file in a text editor and resolve the conflicts manually.

3. After resolving the conflicts, add the changes to the staging area:
   `git add index.html`

4. Commit the merge:
   `git commit -m "Merge feature2-branch into main"`

## Deleting Branches

1. To delete "feature-branch", run:
   `git branch -d feature-branch`

2. To delete "feature2-branch", run:
   `git branch -d feature2-branch`
